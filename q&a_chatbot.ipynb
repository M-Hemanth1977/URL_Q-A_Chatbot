He went on to star in other commercially successful films such as Chatrapathi (2005), Bujjigadu (2008), Billa (2009), Darling (2010), Mr. Perfect (2011), and Mirchi (2013), winning the Nandi Award for Best Actor for his performance in the lattermost.[12][13] He went on to play a dual role in the epic action duology Baahubali: The Beginning (2015) and Baahubali 2: The Conclusion (2017), with the latter emerging as the highest-grossing Indian film at that point, establishing Prabhas as the first pan-Indian star.[14][15][16][17] He achieved further box office success with the action thriller Saaho (2019), the action drama Salaar: Part 1 – Ceasefire (2023), and the science fiction film Kalki 2898 AD (2024).[18][19]\\nPrabhas is the only Indian actor to have six films with a worldwide gross opening of over ₹100 crore.

Additionally, Prabhas is the first South Indian actor to receive a wax sculpture at a Madame Tussaud\\'s museum.[20]\\n\\n\\nEarly life and education\\nPrabhas was born on 23 October 1979 in a Telugu family to film producer Uppalapati Surya Narayana Raju and Siva Kumari in Madras (now Chennai). The youngest of three children, he has an elder brother, Prabodh, and elder sister, Pragathi.[3][21][22] He is the nephew of Telugu film actor Krishnam Raju.[3] His family hails from Mogalthur, near Bhimavaram of West Godavari district, Andhra Pradesh.[23]\\nPrabhas did his schooling at Don Bosco Matriculation Higher Secondary School, Chennai, and at DNR High School, Bhimavaram.[24] He then completed his intermediate education from Nalanda College, Hyderabad.[25][24] He later went on to pursue Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) from Sri Chaitanya College, Hyderabad.[26] He is also an alumnus of Satyanand Film Institute, Visakhapatnam.[27]\\n\\nCareer\\n2002–2014: Early work and career progression\\nPrabhas made his debut with the 2002 action drama Eeswar. In 2003, he followed up with Raghavendra, which received mixed reviews while Idlebrain stated that Prabhas is so good in this film that you can watch it only for him, he is the superstar in making, and all he needs is the right director and right break.[28] He attained his breakthrough with the action romance Varsham (2004), which went on to be a blockbuster and one of the highest grossing Telugu films of the year.[29] He received his first nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu. He appeared in Adavi Raamudu (2004), the same year which received mostly negative reception from the critics and audience alike. In 2005, he appeared in Chakram, which received mixed reviews and went on to win two Nandi Awards.[30] Prabhas portrayed the role of a refugee, exploited by goons, in S. S. Rajamouli\\'s action drama Chatrapathi, the same year. It emerged as a blockbuster and had a 100-day run in 54 centers.[31] Idlebrain.com stated that \"he had a unique style and macho charm in his screen presence\".[32] Chatrapathi earned him his second nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu.\\nIn 2006, Prabhas starred in the musical drama Pournami, which garnered mixed critical reception but earned praise for the cast\\'s performances. In 2007, he starred in action drama Yogi and Munna, both of which received lukewarm response from both audience and fans alike. In 2008, Prabhas collaborated with the director Puri Jagannadh for action-comedy Bujjigadu which gave him a much needed box-office comeback and he received critical acclaim for his performance.[33] In 2009, Prabhas played a dual role in the action thriller Billa (2009), which went on to be a blockbuster at box-office.[34] Later that year, he starred in Ek Niranjan (2009), which opened to mixed reviews, and earned him his third nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu.\\nIn 2010, he appeared in the romantic comedy Darling which received positive reviews from audiences and critics. It went on to be one of the highest grossers of the year and critics lauded Prabhas\\'s performance, as the major highlight of the film.[35] The Times of India noted the film to be derivative and that the director hasn\\'t really come out of his previous work Tholi Prema.[36] In 2011, Prabhas starred in romantic drama Mr. Perfect, which received positive reviews and went on to be a blockbuster. His performance in the film earned him his fourth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu. The Statesman described the film as a \"timeless classic\".[37] The review site GreatAndhra rated the film with three stars and noted \"The film comes across as a clean, family entertainer and the intention of the makers must be appreciated.[38] In 2024, the film was re-released in Japan, garnering unanimous positive responses from the fans and the audiences alike, with every show selling out.[39]\\nIn 2012, Prabhas starred in the action Rebel, received mixed reviews from critics and underperformed at the box office. It was praised for cast performances, action sequences, and production values, but criticised for its plot and screenplay. The Times of India and NDTV stated that, the film serves up fare for the mass audience, and hard-core Prabhas fans.[40][41] He also rendered his voice for a short duration in the film Denikaina Ready (2012).[42] In 2013, Prabhas starred in Mirchi, which opened to positive reviews and went on to be a blockbuster. It was one of the highest grossing Telugu films of the year as well as one of the highest-grossing Telugu films of all time, at the time of its release.[43] His performance in the film earned him his fifth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu. NDTV gave the film a mixed review, stating that \"apart from good direction and strong performance by the lead actor, Mirchi lacks narrative power and is loosely based on an amalgamation of some old films\".[44] Idlebrain stated that \"Mirchi is a film that is made to do a commercial hit. Prabhas entertains with Mirchi and director does a decent work. On a whole, Mirchi has all the ingredients of a commercial potboiler\".[45] He then made his Hindi cinema debut in 2014 in the special dance number \"Punjabi Mast\" from the film Action Jackson.[46]\\n\\n2015–present: Pan-India success, setback and resurgence\\nPrabhas on the sets of Baahubali 2: The Conclusion\\nIn 2015, Prabhas played a dual role as Shivudu/Mahendra Baahubali and Amarendra Baahubali in S.S.

The film eventually grossed over ₹419 crore (US$49\\xa0million) at the box-office.[63] The Telugu version of the film underperformed, while the Hindi version was a hit.[64][65] In 2022, Prabhas appeared in the period romance drama Radhe Shyam which received poor reviews from critics & proved to be a box office bomb.[66][67][68] In 2023, Prabhas portrayed Lord Ram in the mythological action film Adipurush, an adaptation of Hindu epic the Ramayana.[69] It received highly negative response from critics as well as the audience, who criticised the film\\'s screenplay and visuals, and turned out to be another box-office bomb for the actor.[70]\\nPrabhas went on to star in Prashanth Neel\\'s action drama Salaar: Part 1 – Ceasefire (2023), the same year.[71] The film opened to positive reviews and grossed ₹176 crore worldwide on its opening day.[72] It eventually grossed over ₹705 crore (US$82\\xa0million) worldwide and proved to be a comeback film for him.[73] In 2024, he starred in Nag Ashwin\\'s epic science fiction film Kalki 2898 AD.[74][75] Made on a ₹600 crore (US$70\\xa0million) production budget, it is the most expensive Indian film.[76] Kalki 2898 AD grossed over ₹191 crore worldwide on its opening day, which was the third highest first day gross for an Indian film, and making it the fifth and third consecutive ₹100 crore opener worldwide for Prabhas, a feat unheard of in Indian cinema.[77] Rahul Malhotra of Collider quotes that Kalki 2898 AD’s resounding opening cements \"Prabhas as one of the biggest Indian movie stars of his generation\".[78] The film grossed over ₹1,100 crore (US$130\\xa0million) at the box-office, making it the second ₹1,000 crore (US$120 million) film for Prabhas.[79][80]\\n\\nUpcoming projects\\nPrabhas has several upcoming films in various stages of production.[81] In April 2025, he will feature in Kannappa, a mythological drama,[82] in a cameo role and The Raja Saab, a romantic horror-comedy, where he plays the lead role in an ancestral property dispute tale.[83] In 2026, Prabhas will appear in Salaar: Part 2 – Shouryaanga Parvam, the sequel to Salaar;[84] and Spirit, an anti-hero grindhouse drama directed by Sandeep Reddy Vanga.[85] In 2027, he is set to reprise his role as the main protagonist in the epic dystopian sci-fi Kalki 2898 AD - Part 2, re-portraying dual roles of Bhairava and Karna; and Fauji, a patriotic historical action-drama film directed by Hanu Raghavapudi.[86]\\nPrabhas has also entered into a three-film contract with Hombale Films, the production company responsible for notable successes such as KGF, Kantara, and Salaar.
